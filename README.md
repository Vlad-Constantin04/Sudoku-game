I made a Sudoku game in C++.
Explanation:

printGrid: This function is used to print the Sudoku grid.

isSafe: This function checks whether it is safe to place a number in a particular cell, ensuring that the number is not already present in the same row, column, or 3x3 subgrid.

solveSudoku: This is a recursive function that attempts to solve the Sudoku puzzle. It finds an empty cell, tries placing numbers in it, and recursively solves the rest of the puzzle. If it finds a solution, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

main: In the main function, the Sudoku grid is input by the user, and the solveSudoku function is called to solve the puzzle. The solved Sudoku or a message indicating that no solution exists is displayed.
